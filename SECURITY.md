## Supported Versions

If you are using the Wayback Machine and spot a vulnerability on or before an date with an :x:, it will never be fixed. But if the date has an :x: because of lag problems, the date before that can still be updated (if it has a :white_check_mark:).

| Date | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.2022   | :white_check_mark: |
| 31.12.2021   | :x: - Due to lag problems on New Year's Eve, we was not able to complete any updates, so the servers were down from 11 PM.              |
| 29.10.2021  | :white_check_mark: |
| 10.10.2021   | :x:           |
